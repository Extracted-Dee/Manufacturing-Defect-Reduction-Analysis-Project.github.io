# 🏭 Manufacturing Defect Reduction Analysis Project 
### 📊 Quality Improvement in Electronic Board Production

> A data-driven process improvement project focused on reducing welding defects while increasing production capacity in an electronics manufacturing facility.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

A manufacturing plant producing electronic circuit boards experienced a rise in **welding-related defects** during the **Manual Finish (Thru-Hole) process**, while also facing increased product demand.

These defects led to:
- Higher failure rates in final assembly and testing  
- Increased rework and production delays  
- Risk of non-compliance with **IPC-A-610E** quality standards  

### 🎯 Project Goals
- Reduce welding defects by **20%**
- Increase production capacity by **20%** without raising defect rates

---

## 🗂 Dataset Description

The analysis included defect data from:
- The **entire manufacturing facility**
- Multiple **high-volume product models**

Each record included:
- Defect type  
- Affected product model  
- Frequency of occurrence  

This allowed for both **facility-wide** and **model-level** defect analysis.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Skills Demonstrated

- 📈 Defect frequency analysis  
- 🧮 Data aggregation and categorization  
- 🧠 Root cause analysis (Fishbone/Ishikawa method)  
- 🏭 Process improvement strategy development  
- 📊 Data-driven operational decision making  

---

## 🧹 Data Preparation

To ensure consistency and accuracy:

- Standardized defect naming (e.g., *Solder Bridge*, *Excessive Solder*)  
- Grouped defects by type and product model  
- Calculated frequencies to identify high-impact defect categories  

---

## 📊 Exploratory Analysis

### 🔍 Facility-Wide Defect Trends

The most frequent defects across the facility were:

| Rank | Defect Type        | Impact |
|------|--------------------|--------|
| 1️⃣ | **Solder Bridge**     | Highest contributor to failures |
| 2️⃣ | **Excessive Solder**  | Affected solder joint quality |
| 3️⃣ | **Missing Components**| Caused assembly/test failures |

👉 These three defect types became the primary focus for improvement efforts.

### 🏷 Model-Specific Defect Patterns

| Product Model        | Most Common Defects |
|----------------------|---------------------|
| 595407-XXX-00        | Solder Bridges, Missing Components, Lifted Components |
| 595481-00X-00        | Solder Bridges, Lifted Components, Wrong Components |
| 595310-001-00        | Excessive Solder, Solder Bridges, Damaged Components |

🔎 **Key Insight:**  
**Solder Bridge defects appeared across nearly all models**, indicating a systemic process issue rather than a product-specific problem.

### ⚙️ Methods
- Inconsistent soldering procedures  
- Lack of standardized work instructions  

### 👷 People
- Insufficient operator training  
- Worker fatigue  
- Communication gaps between shifts  

### 🏭 Machines
- Equipment calibration issues  
- Inconsistent soldering temperatures  
- Inspection gaps  

### 🧪 Materials
- Poor solder quality or storage  
- Defective or incorrect components  
- Weak incoming material inspection  

---

## 💡 Key Findings

- **Solder Bridge defects** were the most critical and widespread issue  
- Defect patterns were consistent across models, pointing to **process variability**  
- Manual operations showed signs of **training, inspection, and standardization gaps**

---

## 🚀 Recommendations

### ✅ Process Improvements
- Standardize soldering procedures (SOPs)  
- Implement recurring operator certification and training  
- Add visual job aids at workstations  

### 🔧 Equipment & Inspection
- Establish preventive maintenance schedules  
- Improve in-process inspections  
- Consider Automated Optical Inspection (AOI)

### 📦 Material Controls
- Strengthen incoming component inspections  
- Improve solder material handling and storage  

### 👥 Workforce Optimization
- Rotate operators to reduce fatigue  
- Improve shift communication with structured handoff logs

## 📈 Expected Business Impact

If implemented, these improvements would:

✔ Target the highest-frequency defects  
✔ Support a **20% defect reduction goal**  
✔ Enable increased production without quality loss  
✔ Improve compliance with IPC-A-610E standards  
✔ Reduce rework costs and improve operational efficiency  

---

## 🏁 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how structured data analysis combined with quality engineering principles can drive measurable improvements in manufacturing performance.

It highlights the ability to:
- Translate data into operational insights  
- Identify systemic process issues  
- Recommend actionable, business-focused solutions
